hemp: HEadless Music Player

Don Marti <dmarti@zgp.org>

Project status: It Works For Me(tm); plenty of broken stuff.


Goals
=====

  * Don't make the user play music librarian.
    Keeps a hotlist and coldlist of tracks you
    have listened to, and just play something.

  * use GStreamer to handle codecs and stuff.

  * Control a running process with D-Bus.

  * Play directory contents if given a directory
    as argument.

  * LGPL because that's what GStreamer is.


TODO items
==========

  * Parse m3u files.

  * Research D-Bus for other signals to listen to such
    as an "I'm on the phone" signal -- this is what the
    "AUTOPAUSE" state is for.


Using the Pause key under metacity
==================================

In gconf-editor, under
`apps/metacity/global_keybindings`:

        run_command_1    Pause
        run_command_2    <Alt>Pause

Under `keybinding_commands`

        command_1    hemp --playpause
        command_2    hemp --skip


How to make a deb package

Build the packages with:

        debuild -uc -us -i\.git -I.git
